This is a simple integration to setup your own ChatGPT bot with Discord. This little script in combination with keepalive.py is made for replit. 
Create your own Discord bot and OpenAI token.
Setup two env files, add the tokens there and link them into the script.

After running the script copy the generated replit domain and add it to any cronjob you want. 
I use https://uptimerobot.com/.
