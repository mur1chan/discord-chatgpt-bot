# Discord ChatGPT Bot: Simple Integration for Replit

This repository provides a simple integration to set up your own ChatGPT bot with Discord. The compact script works in conjunction with `keepalive.py` and is designed for use with Replit.

## Instructions

1. Create your own Discord bot and obtain an OpenAI API token.
2. Set up two environment variables in your Replit project, and store your tokens there.
3. Link the tokens to the provided script.

After executing the script, copy the generated Replit domain and add it to any cronjob service of your choice. One recommended option is [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/).

With this setup, you can run your ChatGPT bot on Discord 24/7, even on a free Replit account.
